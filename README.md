# Azure & AWS Cross-Cloud Database Integration (Lab Project) üåê

This lab project demonstrates how to integrate AWS and Azure using a **site-to-site VPN**. The goal was to connect an **AWS RDS MySQL database** and an **Azure MySQL database** through an **Azure App Service running phpMyAdmin**. The VPN enables secure cross-cloud communication, allowing phpMyAdmin to manage both databases.

## üìå Project Overview
This lab project was created to **test and apply cloud networking concepts** by integrating AWS and Azure using a **site-to-site VPN**. The goal was to enable secure cross-cloud database communication between an **AWS RDS MySQL instance** and an **Azure MySQL database**, accessible via a **containerized phpMyAdmin instance running on Azure App Service**.

This project allowed me to experiment with:
- **Site-to-site VPN setup** between AWS and Azure
- **Private networking and service integration** (Azure Private Endpoint, AWS RDS subnet groups)
- **Containerized application deployment** using Azure App Service

üí° *Since this was a lab project, all resources were temporary and have been decommissioned.*
