# Azure & AWS Cross-Cloud Database Integration (Lab Project) üåê

## Overview
This lab project explores **cross-cloud networking** by integrating **AWS RDS MySQL** and **Azure MySQL** via a **site-to-site VPN** to a **containerized phpMyAdmin instance** running on **Azure App Service** providing unified database management across both public cloud platforms.

## üìå Project Details
To **test and apply cloud networking concepts**, I set up a **site-to-site VPN** between AWS and Azure, enabling secure cross-cloud database communication. The project involved:

- **Configuring VPN connectivity** between AWS and Azure
- **Integrating private networking** (Azure Private Endpoint, AWS RDS subnet groups)
- **Deploying phpMyAdmin in a container** on Azure App Service for database access

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **AWS:** RDS MySQL, VPN Gateway, Subnet Groups, Security Groups
- **Azure:** MySQL Database, App Service, Private Endpoint, Virtual Network Gateway
- **Networking:** Site-to-Site VPN, VNET Integration, Routing
- **Containerization:** Dockerized phpMyAdmin on Azure App Service

## üîç Key Learnings
- Establishing **secure cloud-to-cloud communication** using Site-to-Site VPNs
- Configuring **private networking** for managed database services
- Deploying **containerized applications** on Azure App Service

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Decommissioning
