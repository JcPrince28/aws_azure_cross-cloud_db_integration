# Azure & AWS Cross-Cloud Database Integration 🌐

This project demonstrates how to integrate AWS and Azure using a **site-to-site VPN**. The goal was to connect an **AWS RDS MySQL database** and an **Azure MySQL database** through an **Azure App Service running phpMyAdmin**. The VPN enables secure cross-cloud communication, allowing phpMyAdmin to manage both databases.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **VPN Configuration**: Site-to-site VPN between **AWS VPC** and **Azure VNet**.
- **Database Connectivity**: Azure App Service (with **VNet integration**) connects to:
  - AWS **RDS MySQL** (via VPN)
  - **Azure MySQL** (via Private Endpoint)
- **Containerized phpMyAdmin**: Runs in **Azure App Service** to manage both databases.

## ☁️ AWS Infrastructure
### AWS VPN & RDS Configuration
- **AWS Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** connects to Azure
- **AWS RDS MySQL** deployed in a **private subnet group**
- **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** for the RDS instance
